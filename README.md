# Description

GeneralAsemblyEMR is a dual-purpose application made to enable medical staff with easy access to patient records, scheduling, and record information while simultaneiously offering patients access to proscription information, appointment times, and their doctor's emergency contact information. The bifurcated design of user types - doctor and patient - is joined by clerical staff who can, from an administration panel, assign doctors to patients, appointments between doctors and patients, and proscriptions to patients.
